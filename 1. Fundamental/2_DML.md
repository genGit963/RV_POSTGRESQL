The diagram focuses on **Data Query Language (DQL)** in PostgreSQL, which is primarily used for querying and retrieving data from databases. Below, I'll teach each topic in-depth with detailed explanations and examples.

---

### **1. SELECT**

The `SELECT` statement retrieves data from one or more tables.

#### **Key Features**

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
  ```
- **Example**:

  ```sql
  SELECT id, name FROM employees;
  ```

  Retrieves the `id` and `name` columns from the `employees` table.

- **All Columns**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees;
  ```
  Retrieves all columns.

---

### **2. FROM**

The `FROM` clause specifies the table(s) to retrieve data from.

- **Example**:

  ```sql
  SELECT name, department FROM employees;
  ```

  Data is fetched from the `employees` table.

- **Multiple Tables** (Used with joins, explained later):
  ```sql
  SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
  FROM employees
  JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
  ```

### **3. JOIN**

Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns.

#### **Types of Joins**

1. **INNER JOIN**:
   Returns rows that have matching values in both tables.

   ```sql
   SELECT e.name, d.department_name
   FROM employees e
   INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
   ```

2. **LEFT JOIN**:
   Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table.

   ```sql
   SELECT e.name, d.department_name
   FROM employees e
   LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
   ```

3. **RIGHT JOIN**:
   Returns all rows from the right table, and matched rows from the left table.

   ```sql
   SELECT e.name, d.department_name
   FROM employees e
   RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
   ```

4. **FULL OUTER JOIN**:
   Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables.

   ```sql
   SELECT e.name, d.department_name
   FROM employees e
   FULL OUTER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
   ```

5. **CROSS JOIN**:
   Produces the Cartesian product of both tables (every row of the first table is combined with every row of the second).
   ```sql
   SELECT e.name, d.department_name
   FROM employees e
   CROSS JOIN departments d;
   ```

---

### **4. WHERE**

The `WHERE` clause filters rows based on conditions.

- **Syntax**:

  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```

- **Examples**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM employees WHERE age > 30;
  SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT';
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'A%';  -- Starts with 'A'
  ```

---

### **5. GROUP BY**

The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows sharing a property so that aggregate functions can be applied to each group.

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department;
  ```
  - Groups employees by department and counts the number of employees in each department.

---

### **6. HAVING**

The `HAVING` clause filters groups after aggregation (like `WHERE`, but for grouped data).

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
  ```
  - Filters departments with more than 5 employees.

---

### **7. ORDER BY**

The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result set.

#### **Sorting Options**:

- **Ascending (ASC)**: Default.
- **Descending (DESC)**.

- **Examples**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, age FROM employees ORDER BY age ASC;
  SELECT name, age FROM employees ORDER BY age DESC;
  ```

---

### **8. LIMIT**

The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows returned by a query.

- **Example**:

  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM employees LIMIT 10;
  ```

  - Returns only the first 10 rows.

- **Combined with OFFSET**:
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM employees LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5;
  ```
  - Skips the first 5 rows and retrieves the next 10 rows.

---

### Key Takeaways for DQL in PostgreSQL:

1. **Joins are essential** for combining data across multiple tables.
2. Use **`WHERE`** for filtering rows and **`HAVING`** for filtering after grouping.
3. **`GROUP BY`** works best with aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, or `AVG()`.
4. Use **`ORDER BY`** for sorting, and combine **`LIMIT`** with `OFFSET` for pagination.
