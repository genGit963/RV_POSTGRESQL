### 1. Introduction to DDL (Data Definition Language)

#### **Definition and Role of DDL:**

- DDL (Data Definition Language) refers to the subset of SQL commands used to define and manage database structures such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas.
- It does **not** handle the data itself; rather, it defines how data is stored and accessed.
- **Key DDL Commands**:
  - `CREATE`: Defines a new structure (e.g., table, index).
  - `DROP`: Removes an existing structure.
  - `ALTER`: Modifies an existing structure.
  - `RENAME`: Renames a database object.

#### **Key DDL Operations in PostgreSQL:**

- In PostgreSQL, DDL operations are performed through SQL commands that define database objects and their properties.
- These operations usually require superuser privileges or ownership of the object being modified.

### 2. Targets in DDL

#### **Database:**

- The database is the highest-level object in PostgreSQL. It contains all the tables, schemas, and data.
- **CREATE DATABASE:**

  - Syntax:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE db_name;
    ```
  - You can specify additional options such as encoding, template, and locale.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE mydb WITH ENCODING 'UTF8' OWNER db_owner;
    ```

- **DROP DATABASE:**
  - Syntax:
    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE db_name;
    ```
  - Use `CASCADE` to automatically remove dependent objects.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE mydb CASCADE;
    ```

#### **Table:**

- A table is a structured format to store rows of data, defined by columns and their data types.
- **CREATE TABLE:**

  - Syntax:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE table_name (
        column1 datatype,
        column2 datatype,
        ...
    );
    ```
  - Example:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE users (
        user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(100),
        email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
    );
    ```

- **DROP TABLE:**
  - Syntax:
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE table_name;
    ```
  - You can use `CASCADE` to remove any dependent objects.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE users CASCADE;
    ```

#### **Constraints:**

- Constraints define rules to ensure data integrity and correctness.
- **Types of Constraints:**

  - **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each record.
  - **Foreign Key**: Links rows in one table to rows in another.
  - **Unique**: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
  - **Check**: Ensures values in a column meet a specific condition.
  - **Not Null**: Ensures a column cannot have a NULL value.

- **Creating Constraints in PostgreSQL:**

  - Example of Primary Key:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE employees (
        employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(100),
        department_id INT
    );
    ```

  - Example of Foreign Key:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE departments (
        department_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        department_name VARCHAR(100)
    );

    CREATE TABLE employees (
        employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(100),
        department_id INT,
        FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
    );
    ```

  - Example of Check Constraint:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE products (
        product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        price NUMERIC CHECK (price > 0)
    );
    ```

#### **View:**

- A view is a virtual table created by querying one or more tables.
- **CREATE VIEW:**

  - Syntax:
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW view_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```
  - Example:
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
    SELECT name, department_name
    FROM employees
    JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
    ```

- **DROP VIEW:**
  - Syntax:
    ```sql
    DROP VIEW view_name;
    ```

#### **Index:**

- An index is used to speed up retrieval operations on a table.
- **CREATE INDEX:**

  - Syntax:
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2);
    ```
  - Example:
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON employees (name);
    ```

- **DROP INDEX:**
  - Syntax:
    ```sql
    DROP INDEX index_name;
    ```

### 3. Operations in DDL

#### **CREATE:**

- The `CREATE` command is used to define new database objects like tables, indexes, views, and databases.
- Syntax for creating various objects has been covered in the previous sections.

#### **DELETE (DROP):**

- The `DROP` command removes an existing object, such as a table, view, or index, from the database permanently.
- Syntax for `DROP` has been included in the table above.

#### **UPDATE:**

- The `UPDATE` command is used to modify existing records in a table.
- Syntax:
  ```sql
  UPDATE table_name
  SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
  WHERE condition;
  ```
- Example:
  ```sql
  UPDATE employees
  SET department_id = 2
  WHERE employee_id = 5;
  ```

#### **RENAME:**

- The `RENAME` command is used to change the name of an object.
- **RENAME Table:**

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE old_table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;
  ```

- **RENAME Column:**
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN old_column_name TO new_column_name;
  ```

### 4. Integrity Methods for Databases

#### **Primary Key:**

- A primary key is a constraint that uniquely identifies each record in a table. A table can only have one primary key.
- Syntax:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      column1 datatype PRIMARY KEY,
      column2 datatype
  );
  ```

#### **Foreign Key:**

- A foreign key creates a relationship between two tables, enforcing referential integrity.
- Syntax:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      column1 datatype,
      column2 datatype,
      FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES other_table (column_name)
  );
  ```

#### **Unique Constraint:**

- The unique constraint ensures that all values in a column are distinct.
- Syntax:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      column1 datatype UNIQUE
  );
  ```

#### **Check Constraint:**

- The check constraint ensures that values in a column meet specific conditions.
- Syntax:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      column1 datatype CHECK (condition)
  );
  ```

#### **Not Null Constraint:**

- The not null constraint ensures that a column cannot have a null value.
- Syntax:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      column1 datatype NOT NULL
  );
  ```
